Run db/schema.sql in the terminal to activate the database and then do "npm run seed" to run the index.js for the seeded data. Then to start the server, input "npm start".

## Usage
Once the server has been accessed there are various ways to view and interpolate the data. Specific seeded data can be accessed through the links /api/products, /api/categories, and /api/tags. Also, Put, Post, and Delete can be implemented to alter the data.
